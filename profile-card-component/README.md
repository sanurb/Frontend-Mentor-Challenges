## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (named classes according to BEM)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In the future I will try to apply the design with frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This helped me for CSS resets.
